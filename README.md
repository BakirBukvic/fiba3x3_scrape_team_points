In some FIBA 3x3 tournaments there is a limit on how many teams can play.
If more teams sign up than the limit, only the teams with the highest total player points get to participate. 
The problem is FIBA does not show these totals anywhere. You have to open each team page and add up the player points yourself.

This tool solves that problem. 
You give it the tournament URL and it collects all the player points from every team. Then it adds those points together to get the team totals. It outputs the results in CSV and JSON files sorted from highest to lowest points.

This way you can quickly see which teams are most likely to make it into the tournament.

Sometimes FIBA blocks access or hides data depending on where you are. If that happens try using a VPN and pick a server in the same country as the tournament.
For example if the tournament is in the Netherlands use a VPN server in the Netherlands.

The main url is hardoced here CTRL + F it main_url = "https://play.fiba3x3.com/events/f1acc405-6c91-4539-8ce9-f3987a8d191f/teams"
Just change that to the tournament you want.
